        <p>
          I'm 21 years old computer science student currently living in Prague, Czech Republic.
          In 2014, I graduated at the <a href="http://www.ssps.cz">SSPŠ</a> high school, where I was studying
          Technical Lyceum program with IT specialization. During the high school I was doing
          several extra curricular activities. I completed
          <a href="http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/training-events/training-certifications/certifications/associate/ccna-routing-switching.html">CCNA</a>
          computer networking certificates.  As my graduation project
          I created <a href="https://github.com/jansuchomel/krivky/releases/download/1.0/Kivky.pdf">study material</a> (cz)
          about Mathematics (parametric expression of planar and spatial curves)
          that is used at the <a href="http://fa.cvut.cz">Faculty of Architecture</a> of Czech Technical University.
          Since 2014 I'm studying computer science at the Charles University,
          <a href="http://mff.cuni.cz">Faculty of Mathematics and Physics</a> where I am currently
          working on a bachelor degree.
        </p>
        <h2>Interests and skills</h2>
        <p>
          Most of the time I write software in C++, Javascript or Python. To varying extent I can also use
          Java, C#, bash/zsh, Haskell, Prolog, SASS, XQuery, XSLT, (PL/)SQL and others. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I've got also some knowledge in computer networks, security and algorithms. I can also
          manage Linux servers.
        </p>
        <h2>Software</h2>
        <p>
          On my <a href="https://github.com/jansuchomel">github</a> page you can find several programs I've been playing with.
          Nothing really useful or finished there at the moment. I <em>hope</em> one day I will get
          <a href="https://github.com/hope-player/hope">hope</a>, the music
          player based on web technologies (ES6, react, redux, electron, ...) and mpv, to some useful state.
        </p>
        <p>
          Time to time I try to contribute to several free software projects. For example, I made a small contribution
          to the <a href="https://github.com/clementine-player/Clementine">Clementine</a> music player.
